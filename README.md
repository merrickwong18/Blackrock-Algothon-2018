# Blackrock-Algothon-2018
Blackrock Algothon, 20-21, Oct, 2018

With over 200 attendees and 40 teams made up of undergraduates to PhDs, the algothon consisted of 3 tracks from hardest to easiest where each team attempts 1 track.

1. Freestyle algorithm: Using any sources of data, come up with an innovative algorithm
2. Kaggle: Given data of an UNKNOWN asset's price ticks from 1/1/2014-31/12/2017, and 10 years of Reuters news titles from 2007-2017, submit a prediction for every hour from 1/1/2018-1/6/2018
3. Quandl: Given well processed and cleaned data of Facebook, Instagram etc, implement a trading strategy

I lead our team in the Kaggle challenge, placing among the final 2 teams for Kaggle and 6 teams across all tracks. Our approach is summarized in the powerpoint.

I am extremely grateful to Thomas Wong for building the database infrastructure to handle 50GB of data on a laptop efficiently.
